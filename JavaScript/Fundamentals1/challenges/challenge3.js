/* 
There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each
other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!
Your tasks:
1. Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
as well (draw means they have the same average score)
Write your code below. Good luck! ðŸ™‚

const scoreDolphins = (96 + 108 + 89) / 3;
const scoreKoalas = (88 + 91 + 110) / 3;

if (scoreDolphins > scoreKoalas) {
    console.log("Dolphins win the trophy");
} else if (scoreKoalas > scoreDolphins) {
    console.log("Koalas win the trophy");
} else {
    console.log("Both win the trophy");
